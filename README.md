## Task Tracker is a website, made with HTTML, Bootstrap and React JS where you can add tasks, due time and date through forms. You can also mark them as "Done" and delete the tasks as per requirements, filter the tasks based on completed or uncompleted. And don't get afraid!! this site won't lose your previous tasks after page refresh or after closing the browser until or unless you delete the tasks.
